description: My Dumb Philosophy on How to Enjoy your Life
---

I used to rush through life—always planning, worrying, and trying to control every outcome. I never stopped to breathe or appreciate what was right in front of me. Over time, I realized that constantly thinking about the future and feeling frustrated when things didn’t go my way was draining my energy and taking away the joy of simply living.

I started wondering: What’s actually keeping me from enjoying life?

That’s when I started thinking about the not-so-obvious reasons we struggle to feel happy and what we might need to truly enjoy life. This blog isn’t too personal or too general—just some thoughts that might help you look at things differently. Hope you have fun reading!

### Be Patient

You might not realize how big a deal patience is if you’re already patient.  
But if you’re an impatient person? Life can feel like a constant mess.

You’re always rushing, always frustrated that things aren’t happening as fast as you planned. You’re constantly calculating, overthinking the future, and stressing when things don’t go your way.

**Impatience usually comes with ego.** When you think things must happen your way, it’s easy to overlook what’s really going on around you. Letting go of ego is a big step toward fixing impatience. People who are impatient rarely live in the present moment, which makes them tired and angry because it feels like everything is going wrong.

To break free from this cycle, start by noticing your own reactions. Let go of control. Accept that things will take time. The more you force things, the more exhausted and angrier you’ll feel. 

Patience isn’t just waiting—it’s learning to be okay with the wait.

### Live in the Present

Who are the happiest people in life?  

Most would say kids.  

They don’t stress over the past or worry about the future. They’re just here. Alive. Enjoying what they have without thinking too much about what’s next.  

They don’t judge others. They don’t worry about being judged. They’re not trying to impress anyone.  

And yeah, as adults, we have responsibilities. But that doesn’t mean we can’t make space for presence. Even small moments—watching a sunset, drinking coffee without distractions, laughing with a friend—can bring that same childlike happiness back.  

And I think, this is why many people turn to smoking or drinking. They don’t realize it, but they’re just trying to quiet their overthinking minds and feel present. But there are better ways to do it.

### Non-Judging Community & Friends

We’re social creatures  

We need real interactions and genuine conversations to feel happy.  

We live in a time where communication is instant—yet people feel lonelier than ever. Because likes, comments, and texts don’t replace real conversations.  

Everyone needs a space where they can talk without feeling judged. A place where they don’t have to put on a mask.  

And yeah, that’s why many people drink in groups. It’s not just about the alcohol—it’s about being in a space where nobody is overthinking, where people just let things out without fear. It sounds silly, but it’s not wrong either.  

That’s why having real, healthy friendships matters. Someone you can vent to. Someone who listens. Because most insecurities come from not feeling heard.  

If more people truly listened, maybe the world would be calmer, happier, and more understanding. So if you can, be that person who listens openly. And seek out people who do the same for you.

### Health & Self-Love

If you’re not healthy and don’t love yourself, happiness will always be out of reach.

You can have everything else in life, but if you can’t genuinely smile at yourself, it won’t matter.

And let’s be real—many of us grew up in families where self-care wasn’t taught. Where prioritizing yourself was seen as selfish. (That’s a whole topic for another time.)
But here’s a fact: taking care of yourself is not selfish. It’s necessary.

Even something as small as going to the gym or eating better can start changing the way you see yourself. Taking care of your body naturally leads to respecting yourself more.

Forgiving yourself is also part of self-love. We all make mistakes. Learning to move past them is a huge part of being happy. If you find it tough, remember you’re not alone—many people have to learn this skill on their own, since it’s rarely taught at home.

### Contrast

Life is all about contrast.
You appreciate the highs because you’ve felt the lows. You enjoy the wins because you’ve struggled through losses. You can’t truly appreciate good days without the bad ones.

Every challenge you take on will come with a dip. That moment where things get hard, and you feel like quitting. But pushing through that dip is how you grow.

Imagine climbing a mountain. The higher you go, the better the view.

The same applies to life. The bigger the effort, the greater the satisfaction. If you put that effort into something you love, that’s the sweet spot—where hard work doesn’t feel like suffering.

Don’t work a job you hate just for the money so you can “enjoy life” outside of it.

Instead, work toward something that excites you so you can enjoy your life and [be truly alive.](https://www.joss.my/posts/being-alive/)

### Don't take yourself too seriously

I think this is self explanatory:)  

or I'm just lazy to think.
Maybe I'll update this someday.  
Dont take this too seriously, hehe ;)

### End Note

This is my personal philosophy on enjoying my life(at this point:). Yours would be different.  
All I hope is that this blog helps you think about what happiness means for you.


> Nobody can hand you clarity about your life. You have to discover it for yourself.

Many people spend a fortune searching for happiness.  
Some believe money will make them happy, while others think finding the right person will fix everything.  
But the truth is:

> Happiness isn’t something you find outside of yourself—it’s something you build within. It’s a skill, and like any skill, it takes time and practice.

So, keep exploring, be patient with yourself, and remember to **enjoy the little moments**, because thats what life is all about.

> We always search for life’s meaning, trying to figure out all the complex things. I did too. But do those things really matter? I don’t know. Maybe we can find better purposes for our life and time.
>
> If you were going to die tomorrow, what would truly matter to you? Would you spend your last day searching for meaning? Absolutely not—unless you’re some kind of psychopath.
>
> So, deep down, you already know exactly what you care about. And maybe, that’s all that truly matters.
