For the past 6 months, I was on an exploration journey with myself.

I explored a lot of areas and became clearer in most parts of my life. I understood myself like I never did and Crossed most of the little curiosities I had on my bucket list.

I hundred recommend having a personal journey with yourself. You will have a clear purpose for life and start to admire everything in and around you.

I'm mostly calm and peaceful now, and my friends are very surprised to see this calm side of me, as I was always a chaotic one.

When someone asks me what I do now, I smile and say I'm building some common sense, and they laugh. I now anytime choose clarity >>> anything.

If you want to know what I explored other than common sense, check out [bento/josekjames](https://bento.me/josekjames))
