description: How building mental models from books has improved my decision-making and clarity of mind.
---

I’m not a voracious reader. In fact, my relationship with books has always been… **complicated**. Every year, I buy more books than I could probably read in a decade. But for the longest time, I never felt like I truly absorbed them. Sure, I’d flip through pages, underline a few lines, and move on to the next book if it didn’t capture my interest. But ask me about the essence of any book I read earlier? My mind would draw a blank.  

This year, something shifted. I realized that rushing through books just to finish them wasn’t adding value to my life. So, I made a change. I decided to **slow down**.  

Now, I read differently. I pick up one book, and instead of racing to the last page, I savor each chapter. I read it **slowly** and **deliberately**. As I go through the book, I pause to reflect. How does this idea relate to my experiences? How could it shape my decisions? How can I build a **personal model** from this information?  

It’s no longer just about reading. It’s about building. I connect the author’s words to my own life, transforming them into **mental models** that stick with me long after I’ve closed the book.  

This practice has taught me a lot about **patient learning**. I used to rush through my studies, and now I realize how much time I wasted not truly absorbing what I learned. Alongside reading, I’ve started writing down insights, translating them into action, and reshaping my habits.  

Now, when I think about the books I read, they feel alive in my mind. I often revisit ideas or connect them with new ones I encounter.  

Now, I try to prioritize **clarity of mind** above all else. Instead of accumulating disconnected knowledge, I focus on connecting the dots between what I already know. This approach refines my **thinking skills**, enabling me to make better decisions over time.
